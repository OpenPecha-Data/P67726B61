Short Maṇḍala Offering
by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo

dakshyen dü sum longchö gé tsok dang
All my own and others’ possessions and positive actions, accumulated in the past, present and
future,
rabjam kusum shying gi chöpé trin
And clouds of offerings that fill the infinite realms of the three kāyas,1
lo yi lang té palden lamar bul
We imagine now and offer to the glorious teacher:
shyé né chok dang tünmong ngödrub tsol
Accept them, and grant us the accomplishments, ordinary and supreme!
om guru buddha bodhisatva ratna mandala pudza megha samudra saparana samaye ah hung
oṃ guru buddha bodhisatva ratna maṇḍala pūja megha samudra spharaṇa samaye āḥ hūṃ
